            Hello, thank you for taking the time to learn about me! In 2012, I started my journey in the coffee industry. I have spent the past seven years becoming an expert in all things coffee. I now am a part-owner in a coffee shop called Union Coffee Company, based in Milford, New Hampshire.
        </p>
        <p>    
            I currently live in Milford, New Hampshire with my wife and two daughters. In my free time (which is limited) I really enjoy woodworking and exploring new places.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have had a lot of fun spending all of my time in the coffee world, but I have decided to make a career move. In December of 2019, I started a full stack web development bootcamp with UNH in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. My goal is to lay down a strong foundation in my knowledge and skills as a developer and hopefully find a job in the field!
        </p>
